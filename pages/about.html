        dynamic and responsive websites. With a background in computer science
        and years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks.

        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to
        open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge with the community
        through blog posts and tutorials.
